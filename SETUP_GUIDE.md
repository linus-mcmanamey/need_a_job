Complete guide to setting up the Job Application Automation System.

---

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd need_a_job
make first-time-setup
```

The interactive wizard will guide you through the entire setup process.

---

## Setup Modes

### 1. First Time Setup (Recommended)
```bash
make first-time-setup
```

**What it does:**
- Runs an interactive wizard to collect all configuration
- Validates inputs in real-time

- Creates the `.env` file
- Sets up required directories
- Starts all Docker services
- Verifies everything is working

**When to use:**
- First time setting up the project

- Want to configure all features

### 2. Quick Setup
```bash
make quick-setup
```

**What it does:**
- Collects only essential variables (Claude API key)
- Skips optional features
- Creates minimal `.env` file
- Starts services

**When to use:**
- Want to get started quickly
- Will configure optional features later
- Already familiar with the system

### 3. Validate Setup
```bash
make validate-setup
```

**What it does:**
- Checks existing `.env` file
- Validates required variables are present
- Reports missing or incomplete configuration

**When to use:**
- Troubleshooting setup issues
- Verifying configuration after manual edits
- Before starting services

## After Setup

### Start the Application

Services are started automatically, but you can control them:

```bash
# View status
make docker-ps

# View logs
make docker-logs

# Restart services
make docker-restart

# Stop services
make docker-down
```

### Access the Interfaces

- **Gradio UI:** http://localhost:7860
- **API Docs:** http://localhost:8000/api/docs
- **RQ Dashboard:** http://localhost:9181

### Modify Configuration

```bash
# Edit .env directly
nano .env

# Or re-run wizard
make first-time-setup

# Validate changes
make validate-setup

# Apply changes
make docker-restart
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Setup Issues

**"Docker not found"**
- Install Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- Verify with `docker --version`

**"Invalid API key"**
- Verify key starts with `sk-ant-api`
- Get new key from https://console.anthropic.com/
- Re-run setup

**"Setup wizard exits immediately"**
- Check Docker is running: `docker ps`
- Try pulling image manually: `docker pull python:3.11-slim`

### Configuration Issues

**Want to skip a configuration step?**
- Just press Enter when prompted
- You can add it later by:
  - Re-running `make first-time-setup`, or
  - Editing `.env` manually

**Made a mistake during setup?**
- Just re-run `make first-time-setup`
- Choose "Yes" when asked to overwrite

**Need to change settings later?**
- Edit `.env` file directly
- Or re-run setup wizard
- Then restart: `make docker-restart`

---

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` file**
   - Already in `.gitignore`
   - Contains sensitive credentials

2. **Use App Passwords**
   - Never use your actual Gmail password
   - Always generate App Passwords

3. **Rotate credentials regularly**
   - LinkedIn cookies expire ~30 days
   - Consider rotating API keys periodically

4. **Start with Approval Mode**
   - Keep `APPROVAL_MODE=true` initially
   - Only disable after you trust the system

5. **Test with Dry Run**
   - Use `DRY_RUN=true` first
   - Verify CVs/CLs look good
   - Then enable real submissions

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Docker Configuration

Edit `docker-compose.yml` to customize:
- Port mappings
- Resource limits
- Volume mounts
- Network settings

### Custom YAML Configs

Edit files in `config/` directory:
- `search.yaml` - Job search criteria
- `agents.yaml` - Agent behavior
- `platforms.yaml` - Platform settings
- `similarity.yaml` - Duplicate detection

### Scaling Workers

```bash
# Scale to 5 workers
make docker-scale-workers N=5
```
