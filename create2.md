2. **Review Current Documents**: Read the existing CV and cover letter templates
3. **Create Tailored Documents**: Generate customised CV and cover letter matching the job requirements
4. **Organise Outputs**: Save the documents in a new company-specific directory

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Extract Job Advertisement
- Use the WebFetch tool to retrieve the job advertisement from the provided URL
- Extract key information:
  - Company name
  - Job title
  - Key requirements and skills
  - Responsibilities
  - Selection criteria
  - Company culture and values

### Step 2: Read Current Documents
- Read the CV: `current_cv_coverletter/Linus_McManamey_CV.docx`
- Read the cover letter: `current_cv_coverletter/Linus_McManamey_CL.docx`
- Note: These are MS Word documents that need to be handled appropriately

### Step 3: Analyse and Match
- Identify which skills and experiences from the current CV best match the job requirements
- Determine which accomplishments to emphasise
- Identify keywords and phrases from the job advertisement to incorporate
- Consider the company culture and tailor the tone accordingly

### Step 4: Create Tailored Documents
Use the Python script at `create_tailored_application.py` with the following approach:

- **CV Tailoring**:
  - Reorder sections to highlight most relevant experience
  - Emphasise matching skills and technologies
  - Incorporate keywords from the job advertisement
  - Quantify achievements where possible
  - Maintain professional Australian English formatting

- **Cover Letter Customisation**:
  - Open with strong, specific reference to the role and company
  - Address specific selection criteria if mentioned
  - Highlight 2-3 most relevant achievements
  - Demonstrate understanding of company values
  - Maintain a professional yet friendly and engaging tone
  - Close with clear call to action

### Step 5: Create Output Directory
- Create a new directory under `export_cv_cover_letter/`
- Directory name format: `YYYY-MM-DD_CompanyName_JobTitle` (sanitised, lowercase with underscores)
- Example: `2025-01-15_acme_corporation_senior_data_engineer`

### Step 6: Save Documents
- Save the tailored CV as `Linus_McManamey_CV.docx`
- Save the tailored cover letter as `Linus_McManamey_CL.docx`
- Both files should be saved in the new company-specific directory

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Australian English Requirements
- Use Australian spelling (e.g., "organisation" not "organization", "analyse" not "analyze")
- Use Australian date formats (DD/MM/YYYY)
- Incorporate appropriate Australian business terminology

### Tone and Style
- **Professional**: Maintain formal business writing standards
- **Friendly**: Use warm, approachable language without being casual
- **Polite**: Show respect and enthusiasm for the opportunity
- **Confident**: Assert qualifications without being arrogant
- **Specific**: Use concrete examples and quantifiable achievements
- **Action-oriented**: Use strong action verbs

### Formatting Standards
- Clear, scannable structure with appropriate headings
- Bullet points for achievements and responsibilities
- Consistent formatting throughout
- Professional fonts and spacing
- Contact information clearly displayed

## Required Tools
You will need to use:
- **WebFetch**: To retrieve and parse job advertisements from URLs
- **Read**: To access existing CV and cover letter documents
- **Write**: To create new tailored documents
- **Bash**: To create directories and manage file operations
- **Python**: To run the document processing script

## Error Handling
- If the URL is inaccessible, request an alternative source
- If documents cannot be read, verify file paths and permissions
- If company name cannot be determined, ask the user for clarification
- Validate all file operations complete successfully

## Usage Example
```bash
User: /create_cv_&_cover https://www.seek.com.au/job/12345678
```

## Output Confirmation
After completion, provide:
1. Summary of key job requirements identified
2. Main tailoring changes made to CV
3. Key themes emphasised in cover letter
4. Full path to exported documents
5. Confirmation that documents are ready for review

## Important Notes
- Always maintain the integrity of factual information from the original CV
- Never fabricate skills, experience, or qualifications
- Ensure all dates and employment history remain accurate
- Preserve contact information exactly as provided
- Focus on emphasising and reframing existing experience, not inventing new content
- report to the user if there are any issues with connections or functionality - like you cannot rfead any document or you cannot connect to a mcp server or web site
