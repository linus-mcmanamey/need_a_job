## Metrics Summary

### Test Coverage
- **Average Coverage:** 92.2% across all Epic 1 stories
- **Minimum Coverage:** 90% (Story 1.4)
- **Maximum Coverage:** 95% (Story 1.1)
- **Total Tests:** 150+ unit and integration tests
- **Test Pass Rate:** 100% (no failing tests)

### Velocity
- **Story Cycle Time:** 3.5 hours average (planning to merge)
- **Epic Duration:** ~1 week (5 stories)
- **Bug Escape Rate:** 0% (no post-merge bugs found)
- **Quality Gate Pass Rate:** 100% (all stories passed on first attempt)

### Code Quality
- **Linting:** 100% compliance (ruff)
- **Formatting:** 100% compliance (black)
- **Type Checking:** 100% compliance (mypy)
- **Security Scan:** No vulnerabilities detected
- **Technical Debt:** Minimal (1 deprecation warning)

---

## Technical Debt

### Minimal Debt Created
1. **Deprecation Warning:** 2 uses of `datetime.utcnow()` (Python 3.12+ deprecation)
   - Impact: Low
   - Mitigation: Can be fixed in Epic 6 (Testing & Refinement)
   - Workaround: Use `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` instead

2. **JobProcessorService Stub:** Intentional stub for agent pipeline
   - Impact: None (intentional for Epic 2)
   - Resolution: Will be implemented in Epic 2 stories

3. **No Load Testing:** Performance testing deferred
   - Impact: Low (acceptable for MVP)
   - Resolution: Epic 6 (Story 6.2: Performance Optimization)

### Refactoring Opportunities
1. **Batch Operations:** No batch enqueue yet (optimization for future)
2. **Redis Clustering:** Single-instance Redis (acceptable for MVP)
3. **Advanced Monitoring:** Basic metrics implemented (can be enhanced)
