# Security Assessment
security:
  critical_issues: []
  warnings: []
  notes: |
    - No hardcoded credentials (env var substitution used)
    - Email validation with regex pattern
    - Proper error handling prevents information leakage
    - Rate limiting prevents abuse

  reliability:
    status: "PASS"
    notes: "Retry logic for transient failures (60s delay), proper error categorization"

  maintainability:
    status: "PASS"
