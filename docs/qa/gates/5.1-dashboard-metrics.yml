  Code review findings addressed: DatabaseConnection import, synchronous methods, correct column names.
  Auto-refresh timer correctly configured for 30-second intervals.
  Comprehensive error handling with logging throughout service.
  No security issues identified.
  Ready for integration testing with Gradio UI.

# Requirements Traceability
acceptance_criteria_status:
  AC1_display_key_metrics:
    status: "PASS"
    requirement: "Display key metrics (jobs discovered today, applications sent, pending jobs, success rate)"
    test_coverage: "test_get_jobs_discovered_today*, test_get_applications_sent*, test_get_pending_count, test_get_success_rate* (7 tests)"
    implementation: |
      - get_jobs_discovered_today(): Returns count of jobs discovered today (column: discovered_timestamp)
      - get_applications_sent(period): Returns completed applications (filters by submitted_timestamp)
      - get_pending_count(): Returns jobs with pending/failed status
      - get_success_rate(): Calculates completion percentage (completed / total)
    test_evidence: |
      ✓ Jobs discovered today: Returns correct count with CURRENT_DATE filter
      ✓ Applications sent (all time): Returns count with status='completed' filter
      ✓ Applications sent (today): Returns count with date range filter
      ✓ Pending count: Returns count of pending and failed statuses
      ✓ Success rate: Calculates 80.0% (80/100), returns 0.0 when no jobs, returns 0.0 when no completions
    notes: "All metrics implemented with proper error handling and fallback values"

  AC2_status_breakdown_widget:
    status: "PASS"
    requirement: "Status breakdown widget with bar chart showing count by status"
    test_coverage: "test_get_status_breakdown* (2 tests)"
    implementation: |
      - get_status_breakdown(): Returns dict mapping status to count
      - Results ordered by count DESC for chart visualization
      - All statuses: discovered, matched, documents_generated, ready_to_send, sending, completed, pending, failed, rejected, duplicate
    test_evidence: |
      ✓ Status breakdown: Returns dict {'discovered': 25, 'matched': 15, 'completed': 50, 'pending': 10}
      ✓ Status breakdown empty: Returns {} when no data
      ✓ Gradio BarPlot integration: Status data formatted as {'status': [...], 'count': [...]}
    notes: "SQL uses GROUP BY status and ORDER BY count DESC. Gradio BarPlot properly receives formatted data"

  AC3_recent_activity_feed:
    status: "PASS"
    requirement: "Recent activity feed showing last 10 jobs with job_title, company_name, status, timestamp"
    test_coverage: "test_get_recent_activity* (3 tests)"
    implementation: |
      - get_recent_activity(limit=10): Returns list of dicts with job details
      - Joins jobs table with application_tracking (LEFT JOIN for jobs without applications)
      - Returns: job_id, job_title, company_name, status, updated_at
      - Ordered by updated_at DESC (most recent first)
    test_evidence: |
      ✓ Recent activity: Returns 2 jobs with correct fields (job_id, job_title, company_name, status, updated_at)
      ✓ Recent activity respects limit: SQL LIMIT parameter correctly set to 5/10
      ✓ Recent activity empty: Returns [] when no data
      ✓ Dataframe formatting: Timestamps formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM"
    notes: "SQL uses LEFT JOIN to include jobs without application tracking. Data properly formatted for Gradio Dataframe"

  AC4_auto_refresh:
    status: "PASS"
    requirement: "Metrics refresh every 30 seconds"
    test_coverage: "Gradio Timer integration test (implementation verification)"
    implementation: |
      - gr.Timer(30): Timer configured for 30-second intervals
      - timer.tick(fn=load_dashboard_metrics, ...): Calls load_dashboard_metrics on each tick
      - refresh_btn.click(fn=load_dashboard_metrics, ...): Manual refresh button also triggers update
      - dashboard.load(fn=load_dashboard_metrics, ...): Initial load on page load
    test_evidence: |
      ✓ Timer created: gr.Timer(30) in gradio_app.py line 84
      ✓ Timer wired to load function: timer.tick() wired to load_dashboard_metrics (line 90)
      ✓ Manual refresh: refresh_btn.click() also triggers load_dashboard_metrics (line 89)
      ✓ Initial load: dashboard.load() triggers on page initialization (line 93)
      ✓ Output mapping: All 6 dashboard outputs properly configured (jobs_today, apps_sent, pending, success_rate, status_chart, activity_table)
    notes: "Auto-refresh fully integrated with Gradio Timer component. All outputs properly mapped for concurrent updates"
