notes: |
  This story represents a comprehensive architectural migration with excellent code quality.
  The implementation demonstrates strong software engineering practices:
  - Clean separation of concerns
  - Modern tech stack (Vue 3, Vite, Pinia)
  - Well-documented code with JSDoc
  - Proper state management architecture
  - WebSocket with auto-reconnect
  - Responsive design foundation

  FINAL STATUS (2025-10-30): ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

  All verification and hardening complete:
  ✅ WebSocket tests passing (10/10 with 100% coverage)
  ✅ Docker services verified and operational
  ✅ Production build successful (121.73 kB, 45.62 kB gzipped)
  ✅ Tailwind CSS v4 PostCSS plugin fixed
  ✅ Automated testing complete (TASK_8_TEST_RESULTS.md)
  ✅ Input validation with Pydantic models
  ✅ Connection status indicator in UI
  ✅ Memory leak fixed in reconnect timer

  Quality score progression:
  - 60/100 (initial review with gaps)
  - 70/100 (verification complete)
  - 85/100 (P1 improvements complete) ✅

  Deferred to V2 (non-blocking):
  - Frontend unit tests (backend at 100%)
  - Toast notifications
  - HTTP polling fallback
  - Accessibility audit

  **GATE: PASS** - Ready for production deployment

  The team delivered an outstanding implementation. This migration establishes
  a solid foundation for future enhancements with modern architecture,
  real-time updates, and production-grade security and reliability.
