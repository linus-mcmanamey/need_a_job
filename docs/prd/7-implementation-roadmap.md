# 7. Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Project setup (FastAPI, Redis, RQ, DuckDB, Gradio)
- Configuration files (split create2.md into YAMLs)
- DuckDB schema (jobs, application_tracking tables)
- Basic platform poller (LinkedIn MCP only)
- Job queue system (Redis + RQ workers)
- **Deliverable:** Jobs discovered from LinkedIn and stored in DuckDB

## Phase 2: Core Agents (Weeks 2-3)
- Agent base class/interface
- Implement 7 agents (Job Matcher → Application Form Handler)
- Checkpoint system (save/resume)
- **Deliverable:** Job flows through agents, generates tailored CV/CL

## Phase 3: Duplicate Detection (Weeks 3-4)
- Add SEEK and Indeed pollers
- Tier 1 similarity (fuzzy matching)
- Tier 2 similarity (LLM embeddings for 75-89%)
- Duplicate grouping logic
- **Deliverable:** Multi-platform with deduplication working

## Phase 4: Application Submission (Weeks 4-5)
- Application Form Handler implementation
- Email submission (attach CV/CL)

- Complex form detection → mark `pending`
- Status tracking (completed, pending, failed)
- **Deliverable:** End-to-end automation functional

## Phase 5: Gradio UI (Weeks 5-6)
- Dashboard page (metrics, recent activity)
- Job Pipeline page (real-time agent flow, WebSocket)
- Pending Jobs page (retry buttons, error details)
- Approval mode implementation
- Dry-run mode implementation
- **Deliverable:** Functional UI for monitoring and control

## Phase 6: Testing & Refinement (Weeks 6-7)
- End-to-end testing with real job searches
- Error handling improvements
- Resume from checkpoint testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation (setup, usage)
- Bug fixes
- **Deliverable:** MVP COMPLETE - Production-ready system

## V2 Development (Weeks 8-12)
- Intelligence features (interview tracking, timing analysis, patterns)
- Analytics dashboard
- Application history
- Platform plugin system
- Manual override and priority job features

## V3 Development (Future)
- A/B testing framework
- Advanced analytics (keyword correlation)
- Configuration editor UI
- Agent performance monitoring
- Interview and response tracking
