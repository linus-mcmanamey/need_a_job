# Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for an automated job application system designed to discover Data Engineering contract roles across multiple platforms (LinkedIn, SEEK, Indeed), generate tailored application materials (CV and cover letters), and submit applications automatically with intelligent oversight.

The system uses a multi-agent architecture powered by Claude LLM, with human-in-the-loop controls for approval and quality assurance. The goal is to maximize job application efficiency while maintaining quality and personalization.

**Key Objectives:**
- Automate job discovery and application submission end-to-end
- Maintain high-quality, personalized application materials
- Provide visibility and control through intuitive UI
- Learn from application patterns to improve success rates over time
