## Story 2.1: Agent Base Class and Infrastructure

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**As a** developer
**I want to** create a base agent class with common functionality
**So that** individual agents are consistent and easier to implement

**Note:** This story also includes the Checkpoint System functionality (originally planned as Story 2.8 in the PRD). The checkpoint/resume capability is integrated into BaseAgent via `_update_current_stage()` and `_add_completed_stage()` helper methods.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. `BaseAgent` abstract class created with:
   - `process(job_id: str) -> AgentResult` abstract method
   - Configuration loading (agent-specific config from agents.yaml)
   - Claude API integration (model selection per agent)
   - Error handling and logging
   - Execution time tracking
2. `AgentResult` data class created with:
   - `success: bool`
   - `agent_name: str`
   - `output: dict` (agent-specific output data)
   - `error_message: str | None`
   - `execution_time_ms: int`
3. Agent registry system:
   - Register agents in execution order
   - Get agent by name
   - Get next agent in pipeline
4. Database update methods:
   - Update application_tracking.current_stage
   - Append to completed_stages
   - Store stage_outputs
   - Update error_info on failure
5. Unit tests for base agent functionality

### Technical Notes:
- Use ABC (Abstract Base Class) for agent interface
- Integrate with Anthropic Claude API
- Use dataclasses or Pydantic for structured outputs
- Centralized logging with structured log format
- Agent execution: synchronous for MVP, async in future

## Story 2.2: Job Matcher Agent

**As a** Job Matcher Agent
**I want to** score jobs against target criteria
**So that** only relevant jobs proceed through the pipeline

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Agent reads job from database (job_id)
2. Loads search criteria from `search.yaml` (REQ-004):
   - must_have technologies
   - strong_preference technologies
   - nice_to_have technologies
   - Location preferences
3. Scores job using Claude with weighted criteria:
   - must_have_present: 50%
   - strong_preference_present: 30%
   - nice_to_have_present: 10%
   - location_match: 10%
4. Output includes:
   - Match score (0.0 to 1.0)
   - Matched criteria list (which requirements were found)
   - Missing must_have items (if any)
5. Approves job if score ≥ threshold (default: 0.70)
6. Updates application_tracking:
   - Status: "discovered" → "matched" (if approved)
   - Status: "discovered" → "rejected" (if not approved)
   - Stores match score and criteria in stage_outputs
7. Logs decision reasoning

### Technical Notes:

   - From structured field (`salary_aud_per_day`)
   - From job description text if field is null
2. Validates salary range:
   - Minimum: $800 AUD/day
   - Maximum: $1500 AUD/day
3. Handles missing salary data:

4. Output includes:
   - Salary value (if found)
   - Currency (assume AUD)
   - meets_threshold: boolean
   - missing_salary: boolean
5. Updates application_tracking:
