# Story 4.1: Application Form Handler Agent Base

**Epic:** Epic 4 - Application Submission
**Sprint:** Week 4
**Story Points:** 13 (Medium Complexity)
**Estimated Hours:** 3.5-4

---

## Story Overview

Implement the base Application Form Handler agent that detects the submission method for each job posting and routes the application to the appropriate handler. This agent will intelligently identify whether a job requires email submission, simple web form filling, or has a complex form that requires manual intervention.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Agent reads job data and metadata (REQ-004)**
   - Receives complete job posting data from duplicate detection pipeline
   - Accesses job metadata including title, company, description, URL

2. **Detects submission method (REQ-010)**
   - **Email:** Job contains email address for applications (regex pattern matching in description)
   - **Web form:** Job has "Apply" button or application URL (URL detection)
   - **External redirect:** Job redirects to company ATS (Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, etc.)
   - Prioritization: Email > Web Form > External ATS

3. **Stores submission method in application_tracking table**
   - submission_method field updated with detected value
   - application_url stored for reference
   - Status set to "ready_to_send"

4. **Routes to appropriate handler**
   - Email submission → Story 4.2 trigger
   - Simple web form → Story 4.3 trigger
   - Complex web form → Story 4.4 trigger

5. **Handles detection failures gracefully**
   - No clear application method → mark as "pending" with reason
   - Multiple methods available → prioritize per rules above
   - Invalid or missing job data → log error and mark as "failed"

6. **Logs submission method detection and routing decision**
   - Detailed logs for audit trail
   - Detection confidence level
   - Routing decision rationale

---

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Set up ApplicationFormHandler agent class**
   - Create agent.py with handler initialization
   - Define inputs (job_data), outputs (submission_method, routing_decision)
   - Integrate with existing agent framework

2. **Implement email detection logic**
   - Regex patterns for email addresses in job description/contact info
   - Validate email format (basic RFC 5322 check)
   - Extract email address for storage

3. **Implement web form detection logic**
   - Parse job URL and metadata
   - Check for "Apply" button patterns in description
   - Identify application_url field
   - Distinguish from external ATS redirects

4. **Implement external ATS detection**
   - Create ATS domain patterns list (workday.com, greenhouse.io, lever.co, etc.)
   - Detect ATS type from application URL
   - Mark as "external_ats" submission type

5. **Implement routing logic**
   - Based on detected submission_method, determine next handler
   - Create routing decision structure
   - Handle prioritization when multiple methods detected

6. **Implement error handling and fallback**
   - Handle missing/invalid job data
   - Handle ambiguous detection scenarios
   - Mark appropriate status (pending/failed)
   - Store error_info with reason

7. **Add comprehensive logging**
   - Debug logs for detection steps
   - Info logs for routing decisions
   - Error logs for failures
   - Store logs in application_tracking.stage_outputs

## Test Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Email regex patterns (valid/invalid formats)
- ATS domain matching (known domains)
- URL parsing and validation
- Routing logic (all submission types)
- Error handling (missing fields, invalid data)

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end detection pipeline with sample job data
- Routing to appropriate downstream handlers
- Database updates (application_tracking insertion)
- Logging output validation

### Test Data
- Sample job postings with email submission
- Sample job postings with web form
- Sample job postings with external ATS (Workday/Greenhouse)
- Sample job postings with multiple submission methods
- Sample job postings with missing submission info

---

## Technical Notes

**Detection Patterns:**
- Email: `\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b`
- Web form: Check for "Apply" button, /apply paths, application_url field
- External ATS: Match against known domain list

**Database Updates:**
- Table: application_tracking
- Fields: submission_method, application_url, status
- Status values: "ready_to_send" → (routing to next handler)

**Logging:**
- Use existing logging infrastructure
- Include: detection_confidence, method_detected, routing_decision

**Dependencies:**
- Existing job data model
- application_tracking database table
- Agent orchestration framework

---

## Complexity Analysis

**Complexity Level:** Medium
- Multiple detection methods with fallback logic
- Straightforward string/pattern matching
- Error handling for edge cases
- No external API calls or complex algorithms
- Clear routing rules

**Risks:**
- Regex patterns may need refinement based on real data
- ATS domain list may need maintenance
- Email extraction could have false positives

---

## Estimated Effort

- **Implementation:** 2.5-3 hours
- **Testing:** 0.5-0.75 hours
- **Code Review & Refinement:** 0.5 hours
- **Total:** 3.5-4 hours
