## Dev Notes

### Migration Overview
[Source: GRADIO_TO_VUE3_MIGRATION.md]

This story implements a complete frontend architecture migration from Gradio to Vue 3 + FastAPI. The backend business logic, agent pipeline, Redis queue system, and DuckDB database remain **unchanged**. Only the UI layer is replaced.

**Key Architectural Changes:**
- **Decoupled UI:** Frontend and backend are separate services
- **Real-time Updates:** WebSocket replaces polling for live updates
- **Modern Stack:** Vue 3 + Vite for fast development and HMR
- **Better Maintainability:** Standard frontend patterns (Pinia, Tailwind, component composition)

### Current Technology Stack
[Source: docs/architecture/12-technology-stack.md]

**Backend (Unchanged):**
- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI 0.100+ (already supports WebSocket)
- Redis 7 + RQ 1.15+ (task queue)
- DuckDB 0.9+ (database)
- Pydantic V2 (data models - works transparently with JSON serialization)

**Frontend (New):**
- Vue 3 (composition API)
- Vite (build tool)
- Pinia (state management)
- Axios (HTTP client)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)

### Architecture Alignment
[Source: docs/architecture/5-component-architecture.md, docs/architecture/13-implementation-patterns.md]

**Design Patterns to Follow:**
1. **Repository Pattern:** Backend already uses this for DuckDB access
2. **Dependency Injection:** Services and agents use DI - maintain this for WebSocket manager
3. **Error Handling Pattern:** Follow existing try/except patterns when adding WebSocket broadcasts

**Component Layer:**
- UI layer sits above FastAPI REST endpoints
- WebSocket manager is a new component in `app/ui/` namespace
- Frontend consumes existing `/api/*` endpoints without modification

### File Structure
[Source: GRADIO_TO_VUE3_MIGRATION.md]

**New Files to Create:**
```
app/ui/websocket.py                    # WebSocket connection manager
frontend/                              # New Vue 3 project root
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Dashboard.vue
│   │   ├── JobTable.vue
│   │   ├── PipelineView.vue
│   │   └── PendingJobs.vue
│   ├── services/
│   │   ├── api.js                     # HTTP client
│   │   └── websocket.js               # WebSocket client
│   ├── stores/
│   │   └── jobStore.js                # Pinia store
│   ├── App.vue
│   └── main.js
├── package.json
├── vite.config.js
├── Dockerfile
└── .env.example
```

**Files to Modify:**
```
app/main.py                            # Add WebSocket endpoint
docker-compose.yml                     # Add frontend service
Dockerfile                             # Remove Gradio
pyproject.toml                         # Remove Gradio dependency
```

**Files to Delete:**
```
app/ui/gradio_app.py                   # Delete entire file
```

### API Endpoints (Existing - No Changes Required)
[Source: Inferred from Epic 5 stories]

The frontend will consume these **existing** FastAPI endpoints:

**Jobs API:**
- `GET /api/jobs` - List all jobs
- `GET /api/jobs/{id}` - Get single job
- `POST /api/jobs/{id}/retry` - Retry failed job

**Pipeline API:**
- `GET /api/pipeline` - Get pipeline status/metrics

**Pending API:**
- `GET /api/pending` - List pending jobs
- `POST /api/pending/{id}/approve` - Approve pending job
- `POST /api/pending/{id}/reject` - Reject pending job

**WebSocket (New):**
- `WS /ws/status` - Real-time status updates

### WebSocket Message Protocol
[Source: GRADIO_TO_VUE3_MIGRATION.md]

**Message Format:**
```json
{
  "type": "event_name",
  "job_id": "optional_job_id",
  "status": "optional_status",
  "data": {}
}
```

**Event Types:**
- `job_update` - Job status changed
- `job_retry` - Job retry triggered
- `job_discovery_complete` - Discovery batch finished
- `pipeline_update` - Pipeline metrics changed

### Testing Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/13-implementation-patterns.md]

**Backend Testing:**
- Location: `tests/ui/` for WebSocket tests
- Framework: pytest + pytest-asyncio
- Pattern: Test WebSocket connect/disconnect/broadcast
- Run: `pytest tests/ui/test_websocket.py -v`

**Frontend Testing (Optional for MVP):**
- Framework: Vitest (if implemented later)
- Component tests: Test component rendering and interactions
- Store tests: Test Pinia store actions and state updates
- E2E tests: Playwright for full user flows (future enhancement)

**Manual Testing Priority:**
1. Verify WebSocket connection in browser DevTools
2. Test real-time updates by triggering backend events
3. Verify all buttons/actions call correct API endpoints
4. Test responsive design at different breakpoints

### Docker Development Workflow
[Source: GRADIO_TO_VUE3_MIGRATION.md]

**IMPORTANT: Docker-First Approach**
- ALL development should be done within Docker containers
- Project initialization uses temporary Node containers
- No local npm/node installation required
- Consistent environment across all developers

**Local Development:**
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up

# Frontend available at: http://localhost:5173
# Backend API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
# WebSocket: ws://localhost:8000/ws/status

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f frontend
docker-compose logs -f app

# Restart specific service
docker-compose restart frontend

# Run npm commands in frontend container
docker-compose exec frontend npm install <package>
docker-compose exec frontend npm run build
```

**Hot Module Replacement (HMR):**
- Vite provides instant HMR for Vue components
- Changes to .vue files reflect immediately in browser
- No restart required during frontend development

### Environment Configuration
[Source: GRADIO_TO_VUE3_MIGRATION.md]

**Development (.env.development):**
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8000/ws/status
```

**Production (.env.production):**
```
VITE_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com/api
VITE_WS_URL=wss://api.yourdomain.com/ws/status
```

**Important:** WebSocket requires WSS (secure WebSocket) in production when using HTTPS.

### Gradio Removal Checklist
[Source: GRADIO_TO_VUE3_MIGRATION.md]

**Before Starting:**
1. Verify Epic 5 stories (5.1-5.5) are complete
2. Ensure Gradio UI functionality is well-documented
3. Take screenshots of Gradio UI for reference

**During Removal:**
1. Search for `import gradio` across codebase
2. Remove `gradio_app.py` file
3. Remove Gradio from `pyproject.toml` [tool.poetry.dependencies]
4. Run `poetry lock && poetry install`
5. Verify `docker-compose up` starts without Gradio errors

### Production Deployment Considerations
[Source: GRADIO_TO_VUE3_MIGRATION.md]

**Frontend Build:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
# Outputs to frontend/dist/
```

**Serving Options:**
1. **Nginx Reverse Proxy (Recommended):**
   - Serve static files from `frontend/dist/`
   - Proxy `/api/*` to FastAPI backend
   - Proxy `/ws/*` to WebSocket endpoint

2. **Include in Backend Container:**
   - Copy `frontend/dist/` into backend Dockerfile
   - Use FastAPI's `StaticFiles` to serve frontend
   - Single container deployment

**Security Notes:**
- Use HTTPS in production
- Configure CORS properly in FastAPI for frontend domain
- WebSocket requires WSS protocol for secure connections

### Known Limitations & Future Enhancements
[Source: GRADIO_TO_VUE3_MIGRATION.md]

**Current Scope (MVP):**
- Dashboard with basic metrics ✅
- Job table with status and actions ✅
- Pipeline view with real-time updates ✅
- Pending jobs management ✅

**Deferred to V2:**
- Story 5.6: Application history and search (already deferred)
- Advanced filtering and sorting
- Job detail modal with full information
- Edit CV/CL before approval
- Dark mode theme
- User authentication
- Multiple user support

### Previous Story Context
[Source: docs/stories/5.5.dry-run-mode.md]

**Key Achievements from Epic 5:**
- 100% test coverage achieved in Story 5.5
- Service layer abstraction pattern established
- TDD methodology proven successful
- Zero technical debt from Epic 5

**Lessons Learned:**
- Comprehensive testing prevents rework
- Service layer makes UI replacement feasible
- Clear separation of concerns enables this migration

**Carryforward:**
- Maintain service layer abstraction
- Keep test coverage high (aim for 90%+ for WebSocket code)
- Follow established patterns from Epic 5 stories

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment**: ✅ **EXCELLENT**

This story demonstrates outstanding software engineering practices and represents a successful architectural migration. The implementation quality is production-grade with:

- **Clean Architecture**: Excellent separation of concerns between frontend/backend
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Vue 3 Composition API, Vite, Pinia, Tailwind CSS - all current versions
- **Code Organization**: Services layer, store layer, components layer properly separated
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc comments, detailed Dev Notes, updated README
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent, self-documenting names throughout
- **WebSocket Implementation**: Solid auto-reconnect logic with proper error handling

**Architectural Strengths**:
1. **Backend WebSocket**: ConnectionManager pattern implemented correctly with singleton
2. **State Management**: Pinia store with reactive refs and computed properties
3. **Component Design**: Self-contained, reusable Vue components with props-based communication
4. **API Integration**: Clean axios-based client with organized endpoint groups
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket event handlers properly integrated with store

**Code Metrics**:
- Files Created: 25+ (complete frontend project + backend WebSocket)
- Files Modified: 15 (app/main.py, docker configs, docs, tests, pyproject.toml, postcss.config.js)
- Files Deleted: 3 (gradio_app.py, start_services.sh, test methods)
- Lines of Code: 2000+ across frontend and backend
- WebSocket Coverage: 100% (app/ui/websocket.py - 28/28 statements)
- Production Build: 121.73 kB (45.62 kB gzipped)

---

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring performed during review.**

Rationale: The implementation quality is already excellent. Code follows established patterns, has good documentation, and requires no structural improvements. Refactoring would be premature without first completing Task 8 manual testing to validate the current design works as intended.

---

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ PASS - Follows Python conventions (PEP 8), Vue 3 best practices
- **Project Structure**: ✅ PASS - Frontend in `frontend/`, backend in `app/`, tests in `tests/`
- **Testing Strategy**: ✅ IMPROVED - Backend tests complete (10/10 passing), frontend lacks unit tests (acceptable for MVP)
- **All ACs Met**: ⚠️ CONCERNS - Implementation verified (ACs 1-6,8), Task 8 manual testing pending (AC 7)

---

### Test Coverage Analysis

**Backend WebSocket Tests**: 10/10 PASSING ✅
- ✅ `test_init` - PASS
- ✅ `test_connect` - PASS (fixed with pytest-mock)
- ✅ `test_disconnect` - PASS (fixed with pytest-mock)
- ✅ `test_broadcast_to_single_client` - PASS (fixed with pytest-mock)
- ✅ `test_broadcast_to_multiple_clients` - PASS (fixed with pytest-mock)
- ✅ `test_broadcast_with_no_connections` - PASS
- ✅ `test_broadcast_handles_failed_client` - PASS (fixed with pytest-mock)
- ✅ `test_websocket_endpoint_exists` - PASS
- ✅ `test_websocket_connection` - PASS
- ✅ `test_singleton_manager` - PASS

**Coverage**: 100% on app/ui/websocket.py (28 statements, 0 missed)
**Status**: All automated tests passing after pytest-mock installation.

**Frontend Tests**: NONE ⚠️
- No unit tests for Vue components
- No unit tests for Pinia store
- No unit tests for WebSocket or API clients
- Manual testing required (Task 8)

**Recommendation**: Add Vitest for frontend unit tests in next sprint (not blocking for MVP).

### Security Review

**Security Status**: ⚠️ **CONCERNS** (acceptable for MVP, hardening needed for production)

**Findings**:
1. ✅ **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured for localhost:5173 (app/main.py:74)
2. ⚠️ **Input Validation**: No Pydantic models for API request validation - endpoints trust frontend input
3. ⚠️ **WebSocket Security**: Production .env has WSS, but no runtime enforcement/validation
4. ⚠️ **Authentication**: None implemented (acceptable for single-user MVP, document V2 requirement)
5. ✅ **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded secrets, environment variables used correctly

**Security Score**: 6/10 (Acceptable for MVP single-user deployment)

**Recommendations**:
- Add Pydantic request models to validate job_id, reason parameters
- Add runtime check to warn if HTTP + WS mixed in production environment
- Document authentication as V2 requirement for multi-user support

---

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Status**: ⚠️ **CONCERNS** (likely performant, but not verified)

**Design Review**:
1. ✅ **Reactive State**: Vue's reactivity and Pinia computed properties are efficient
2. ✅ **WebSocket Protocol**: Low-latency protocol chosen correctly
3. ✅ **Bundle Optimization**: Vite provides automatic code splitting and tree shaking
4. ⚠️ **Memory Management**: Potential leak in reconnectTimer (websocket.js:85-99)
5. ⚠️ **Not Measured**: Page load time, WebSocket latency, bundle size not benchmarked

**Performance Score**: 7/10 (Design is sound, verification needed)

**Recommendations**:
- Add cleanup for reconnectTimer in all error/disconnect paths
- Benchmark page load time (target < 2 seconds)
- Measure WebSocket latency (target < 500ms event-to-UI)
- Analyze production bundle size with `npm run build && du -sh dist`
