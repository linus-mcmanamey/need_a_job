# Story 2.3: Salary Validator Agent

## Status
In Progress

**Started:** 2025-10-28
**Branch:** feature/story-2-3-salary-validator-agent

## Story
**As a** Salary Validator Agent,
**I want to** validate that job salary meets minimum requirements,
**so that** only adequately compensated jobs proceed through the pipeline.

## Context
This is the third story in Epic 2 (Core Agents). The Salary Validator Agent is the second specialized agent in the 7-agent pipeline, following the Job Matcher Agent. It performs a straightforward validation: ensure the job's salary meets the minimum threshold defined in search criteria.

This agent is intentionally simple and uses Claude Haiku (lightweight model) for salary extraction when needed, but primarily relies on structured salary fields. Unlike Job Matcher, this agent does NOT reject jobs - it flags missing/low salaries but allows them to proceed (salary data can be shared from duplicate detection later).

## Dependencies
- ✅ Story 2.1: Agent Base Class (provides BaseAgent)
- ✅ Story 2.2: Job Matcher Agent (pattern reference)
- ✅ Story 1.3: DuckDB Schema (application_tracking table)
- ✅ Story 1.2: Configuration System (search.yaml)

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC 1: SalaryValidatorAgent Class Implementation
- [ ] Create `SalaryValidatorAgent` class in `app/agents/salary_validator_agent.py`
- [ ] Inherit from `BaseAgent` abstract class
- [ ] Implement `async def process(self, job_id: str) -> AgentResult` method
- [ ] Override `agent_name` property to return "salary_validator"
- [ ] Override `model` property to return "claude-haiku-3.5" (lightweight)
- [ ] Load job data from database using job_id
- [ ] Load salary expectations from search.yaml

### AC 2: Salary Extraction from Structured Field
- [ ] Extract salary from job data field: `salary_aud_per_day`
- [ ] If field is present and not null, use it directly
- [ ] Parse numeric value handling formats: "800", "$800", "800.00"
- [ ] Currency assumed to be AUD (Australian Dollars)
- [ ] Time period assumed to be per day for contract roles

### AC 3: Salary Extraction from Job Description
- [ ] If `salary_aud_per_day` is null/missing, extract from job description text
- [ ] Use Claude Haiku to parse salary from unstructured text
- [ ] Handle various formats:
  - "$800-1000 per day"
  - "100k pa" or "100k annual" (convert to daily)
  - "1000/day" or "1000 per day"
  - "$100-120k annual" (convert to daily, use midpoint)
- [ ] Conversion formula for annual: daily_rate = annual_salary / 230 working days
- [ ] Store extracted salary back to jobs table (update missing field)

### AC 4: Salary Threshold Validation
- [ ] Load minimum salary from search.yaml: `salary_expectations.minimum` (default: 800 AUD/day)
- [ ] Load maximum salary from search.yaml: `salary_expectations.maximum` (default: 1500 AUD/day)
- [ ] Compare extracted salary to minimum threshold
- [ ] Set `meets_threshold: true` if salary >= minimum
- [ ] Set `meets_threshold: false` if salary < minimum
- [ ] Set `missing_salary: true` if salary could not be extracted

### AC 5: Non-Blocking Validation (MVP Behavior)
- [ ] Agent DOES NOT reject jobs based on salary (status remains "matched")
- [ ] Agent flags concerns but allows job to proceed to next agent
- [ ] Rationale: Duplicate detection (Story 3.x) can share salary data from duplicates
- [ ] Flag stored in stage_outputs for downstream agents to review

### AC 6: Database Updates
- [ ] Update application_tracking table:
  - Update `current_stage` to "salary_validator"
  - Append "salary_validator" to `completed_stages` array
  - Store validation output in `stage_outputs` JSON:
    ```json
    {
      "salary_validator": {
        "salary_aud_per_day": 950.0,
        "currency": "AUD",
        "meets_threshold": true,
        "missing_salary": false,
        "extracted_from": "structured_field|job_description",
        "minimum_threshold": 800.0,
        "maximum_threshold": 1500.0
      }
    }
    ```
- [ ] If salary extracted from description, update jobs table with value
- [ ] Use BaseAgent's `_update_database()` methods

### AC 7: AgentResult Construction
- [ ] Return `AgentResult` with:
  - `success`: True if validation completed (even if salary missing)
  - `agent_name`: "salary_validator"
  - `output`: Dictionary containing:
    - `salary_aud_per_day`: float | None
    - `currency`: "AUD"
    - `meets_threshold`: boolean
    - `missing_salary`: boolean
    - `extracted_from`: "structured_field" | "job_description" | "not_found"
  - `error_message`: None (or error details if failed)
  - `execution_time_ms`: int

### AC 8: Error Handling
- [ ] Handle missing job_id gracefully
- [ ] Handle missing job data in database
- [ ] Handle Claude API failures for text extraction (fallback: mark missing_salary=true)
- [ ] Handle unparseable salary formats (mark missing_salary=true)
- [ ] Log all errors with structured logging
- [ ] Never crash - always return AgentResult

### AC 9: Unit Tests
- [ ] Test file: `tests/unit/agents/test_salary_validator_agent.py`
- [ ] Test: `test_salary_validator_inherits_base_agent()`
- [ ] Test: `test_extract_salary_from_structured_field()`
- [ ] Test: `test_extract_salary_from_description_daily_rate()`
- [ ] Test: `test_extract_salary_from_description_annual()`
- [ ] Test: `test_convert_annual_to_daily_rate()`
- [ ] Test: `test_salary_meets_threshold()`
- [ ] Test: `test_salary_below_threshold()`
- [ ] Test: `test_missing_salary_handling()`
- [ ] Test: `test_non_blocking_validation()`
- [ ] Test: `test_database_updates()`
- [ ] Test: `test_update_jobs_table_with_extracted_salary()`
- [ ] Test: `test_error_handling_missing_job()`
- [ ] Test: `test_error_handling_claude_failure()`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Claude Prompt for Salary Extraction
```
You are a Salary Extraction Agent. Extract the salary information from the job description.

JOB DESCRIPTION:
{job_description}

TASK:
Extract the salary or daily rate mentioned in the job description.
Look for patterns like: "$X per day", "X/day", "$Xk annual", "$X-Y pa", etc.

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only):
{
  "salary_found": true|false,
  "amount": 950.0,
  "time_period": "daily|annual",
  "currency": "AUD",
  "notes": "Found in description as '$950 per day'"
}

If no salary information found, return: {"salary_found": false}
```

### Annual to Daily Conversion
```python
def convert_annual_to_daily(annual_salary: float) -> float:
    """Convert annual salary to daily rate (230 working days/year)"""
    WORKING_DAYS_PER_YEAR = 230
    return annual_salary / WORKING_DAYS_PER_YEAR
```

### Salary Format Parsing
```python
import re

def parse_salary_value(salary_str: str) -> float | None:
    """Parse salary string to numeric value"""
    # Remove currency symbols, commas
    cleaned = re.sub(r'[$,]', '', salary_str.strip())

    # Handle "k" suffix (thousands)
    if 'k' in cleaned.lower():
        cleaned = cleaned.lower().replace('k', '')
        return float(cleaned) * 1000

    # Try direct float conversion
    try:
        return float(cleaned)
    except ValueError:
        return None
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and tested
- [ ] Unit tests pass with ≥90% code coverage
- [ ] Integration tests pass (deferred to 2.8)
- [ ] Agent registered in AgentRegistry
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No regressions in existing tests

## Notes
- This agent is intentionally simple compared to Job Matcher
- Uses claude-haiku-3.5 (cheaper, faster) since logic is straightforward
- Non-blocking design: flags concerns but doesn't reject jobs
- Salary sharing via duplicate detection comes in Epic 3

**Story Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Complexity:** LOW (simpler than Story 2.2)
**Actual Duration:** ~1.5 hours (as estimated)
