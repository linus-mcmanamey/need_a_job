# Story 3.1: SEEK Job Poller

## Status
COMPLETE - Retrospective Documented

**Created:** 2025-10-29
**Completed:** 2025-10-29
**Retrospective:** 2025-10-29
**Epic:** Epic 3 - Duplicate Detection
**Story Points:** Medium (3.5 hours estimated, 1.58 hours actual)
**Branch:** feature/story-3-1
**PR:** #13 (merged to main, commit 37973a1)

## Story Overview

**As a** system,
**I want to** search SEEK for jobs matching my criteria,
**So that** I discover jobs from Australia's largest job platform.

### Context
First story in Epic 3: Duplicate Detection. Extends job discovery beyond LinkedIn to SEEK (Australia's largest job platform). This poller will use web scraping (BeautifulSoup/Playwright) to search and extract job data from SEEK, following the same patterns established by the LinkedInPoller in Story 1.4.

SEEK is Australia's #1 employment marketplace and will significantly expand our job discovery coverage. Unlike LinkedIn which has MCP API access, SEEK requires web scraping which introduces additional complexity around:
- JavaScript rendering
- Anti-bot measures
- Rate limiting
- HTML parsing variability

## Dependencies

### Prerequisite Stories
- ✅ Story 1.1: Project Setup (FastAPI, DuckDB, dependencies)
- ✅ Story 1.2: Configuration System (YAML config loading)
- ✅ Story 1.3: DuckDB Schema (jobs table, application_tracking table)
- ✅ Story 1.4: LinkedIn Job Poller (establishes poller pattern)
- ✅ Story 1.5: Job Queue System (Redis + RQ workers)
- ✅ Epic 2: Core Agents (for processing discovered jobs)

### External Dependencies
- 📦 BeautifulSoup4 (for HTML parsing) - needs installation
- 📦 requests library (HTTP requests) - already installed
- 📦 Playwright (if JavaScript rendering needed) - optional fallback
- 🔧 Docker MCP Gateway (browser tools available)

### Configuration Dependencies
- config/search.yaml - existing, needs SEEK section
- config/platforms.yaml - existing, needs SEEK configuration

       url = f"{base_url}/{search_term}-jobs/in-{location_slug}"
       if page > 1:
           url += f"?page={page}"
       return url
   ```

2. Implement HTML fetching with rate limiting:
   ```python
   def _fetch_page(self, url: str) -> str:
       self.rate_limiter.wait_if_needed()
       delay = random.uniform(self.min_delay, self.max_delay)
       time.sleep(delay)

       headers = {"User-Agent": self.config["seek"]["user_agent"]}
       response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=30)
       response.raise_for_status()
       return response.text
   ```

3. Implement pagination handling:
   ```python
   def _get_all_job_listings(self, keywords: str, location: str) -> list:
       jobs = []
       max_pages = self.config["seek"]["max_pages_per_search"]

       for page in range(1, max_pages + 1):
           url = self._build_search_url(keywords, location, page)
           html = self._fetch_page(url)
           page_jobs = self._parse_job_listings(html)

           if not page_jobs:
               break  # No more results

           jobs.extend(page_jobs)

       return jobs
   ```

4. Implement job listing extraction:
   ```python
   def _parse_job_listings(self, html: str) -> list:
       soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
       job_cards = soup.find_all('article', {'data-automation': 'normalJob'})

       jobs = []
       for card in job_cards:
           job_data = {
               'title': card.find('a', {'data-automation': 'jobTitle'}).text.strip(),
               'company': card.find('a', {'data-automation': 'jobCompany'}).text.strip(),
               'location': card.find('a', {'data-automation': 'jobLocation'}).text.strip(),
               'job_url': card.find('a', {'data-automation': 'jobTitle'})['href'],
               # ... more fields
           }
           jobs.append(job_data)

       return jobs
   ```

**Acceptance:**
- URL construction works for various search terms

   ```python
   def extract_job_metadata(self, job_card_html: str, job_detail_html: str = None) -> Job:
       # Parse basic fields from job card
       # Optionally fetch full details from job page
       # Return Job model instance
       pass
   ```

2. Implement SEEK-specific salary parsing:
   ```python
   def _parse_seek_salary(self, salary_str: str | None) -> Decimal | None:
       """
       Parse SEEK salary formats:
       - "$100,000 - $120,000 per annum" → $522/day average
       - "$1000 per day" → $1000
       - "$1000-$1200 per day" → $1100
       - "Competitive salary" → None
       """
       if not salary_str or "competitive" in salary_str.lower():
           return None

       # Extract numbers
       numbers = re.findall(r'[\d,]+', salary_str)
       numbers = [Decimal(n.replace(',', '')) for n in numbers]

       # Determine if annual or daily
       if "per annum" in salary_str.lower():
           # Convert to daily (230 working days)
           avg_annual = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
           return avg_annual / 230
       elif "per day" in salary_str.lower():
           return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
       elif "per hour" in salary_str.lower():
           # Assume 8 hour day
           avg_hourly = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
           return avg_hourly * 8

       return None
   ```

3. Implement location normalization:
   ```python
   def _normalize_location(self, location_str: str) -> str:
       """
       Normalize SEEK location formats:
       - "Melbourne CBD" → "Melbourne, VIC"
       - "Remote - VIC" → "Remote - VIC"
       - "Hobart, TAS" → "Hobart, TAS"
       """
       # Basic normalization logic
       return location_str.strip()
   ```

4. Implement posting date extraction:
   ```python
   def _parse_posting_date(self, date_str: str) -> date:
       """
       Parse SEEK posting date:
       - "2d ago" → 2 days ago
       - "1w ago" → 1 week ago
       - "15/01/2025" → date object

   ```python
   def _store_job(self, job: Job) -> str | None:
       # Check for duplicate
       existing = self.jobs_repo.get_job_by_url(job.job_url)
       if existing:
           logger.debug(f"Duplicate job skipped: {job.job_url}")
           self.metrics["duplicates_skipped"] += 1
           return None

       # Insert job
       job_id = self.jobs_repo.insert_job(job)
       self.metrics["jobs_inserted"] += 1
       logger.info(f"New job inserted: {job.job_title} at {job.company_name}")

       return job_id
   ```

2. Create application tracking records:
   ```python
   def _create_application_tracking(self, job_id: str) -> str:
       application = Application(
           job_id=job_id,
           status="discovered",
           current_stage=None,
           completed_stages=[],
           stage_outputs={},
           error_info=None
       )

       app_id = self.app_repo.insert_application(application)
       return app_id
   ```

3. Implement full poll cycle:
   ```python
   def run_once(self) -> dict:
       logger.info("SEEK poller started")
       start_time = time.time()

       # Load search criteria
       keywords = self.config["search"]["seek"]["search_terms"]
       location = self.config["search"]["seek"]["location"]

       # Search jobs
       jobs = self._get_all_job_listings(keywords, location)
       self.metrics["jobs_found"] = len(jobs)

       # Process each job
       for job_data in jobs:
           try:
               job = self.extract_job_metadata(job_data)
               job_id = self._store_job(job)

               if job_id:
                   self._create_application_tracking(job_id)
           except Exception as e:
               logger.error(f"Error processing job: {e}")
               self.metrics["errors"] += 1

       # Log summary
       duration = time.time() - start_time
       logger.info(f"SEEK poll complete: {self.metrics} (duration: {duration:.1f}s)")

       return self.metrics
   ```

**Acceptance:**
- Jobs inserted into database successfully
- Application tracking records created
- Duplicate detection prevents re-insertion
- Database errors handled gracefully
- Integration tests pass

### Task 5: Error Handling and Testing (45 minutes)
**Owner:** QA Agent
**Dependencies:** Task 4

1. Comprehensive error handling:
   ```python
   @retry_with_backoff(max_attempts=3, backoff_seconds=[5, 15, 45])
   def _fetch_page_with_retry(self, url: str) -> str:
       # Fetch with automatic retry on connection errors
       return self._fetch_page(url)

   def _handle_parsing_error(self, job_data: dict, error: Exception) -> None:
       logger.warning(f"Failed to parse job {job_data.get('job_url', 'unknown')}: {error}")
       self.metrics["errors"] += 1
       # Continue with other jobs
   ```

2. Unit tests (minimum 80% coverage):
   ```python
   # tests/unit/pollers/test_seek_poller.py

   def test_seek_url_construction():
       # Test URL building for various inputs
       pass

   def test_salary_parsing_annual_range():
       # Test: "$100,000 - $120,000 per annum" → $478.26/day average
       pass

   def test_salary_parsing_daily_rate():
       # Test: "$1000 per day" → $1000
       pass

   def test_duplicate_detection():
       # Test skipping duplicate job_url
       pass

   def test_error_handling_invalid_html():
       # Test graceful handling of malformed HTML
       pass
   ```

3. Integration tests:
   ```python
   # tests/integration/pollers/test_seek_integration.py

   def test_end_to_end_seek_polling(test_db):
       # Test full flow: scrape → parse → store
       pass

   def test_duplicate_handling_with_db(test_db):
       # Test duplicate detection with real database
       pass
   ```

4. Manual testing with saved HTML:
   - Save sample SEEK search result pages
   - Test parsing with various job formats
   - Verify all edge cases handled

**Acceptance:**
- All error scenarios handled gracefully
- Unit tests achieve 80%+ coverage

**Mocking Strategy:**
- Mock `requests.get()` for HTTP responses
- Mock JobsRepository and ApplicationRepository
- Use sample SEEK HTML files for parsing tests
- Mock time.sleep() for rate limiter tests

**Coverage Target:** 80% minimum (excluding operational loop)

### Integration Tests
**Location:** `tests/integration/pollers/test_seek_integration.py`

**Test Cases:**
1. **End-to-End Flow**
   - Mock HTTP, real database
   - Verify jobs inserted correctly
   - Verify application tracking created

2. **Duplicate Handling**
   - Insert same job twice
   - Verify second insertion skipped
   - Verify metrics updated

3. **Batch Processing**
   - Process multiple jobs
   - Verify all inserted correctly
   - Verify partial failures handled

4. **Configuration Loading**
   - Load from YAML files
   - Verify settings applied correctly

**Database:** Use test DuckDB instance, cleanup after tests

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Run poller with --dry-run flag
- [ ] Verify jobs appear in database
- [ ] Check application_tracking records
- [ ] Run twice to test duplicate detection
- [ ] Monitor logs for errors
- [ ] Test with real SEEK website (if possible)
- [ ] Verify rate limiting works in practice

## Technical Notes

### SEEK Website Structure
**Search URL Format:**
```
https://www.seek.com.au/data-engineer-jobs/in-All-Australia?page=1
```

**Job Card HTML Structure (Approximate):**
```html
<article data-automation="normalJob">
  <a data-automation="jobTitle" href="/job/12345">Senior Data Engineer</a>
  <a data-automation="jobCompany">Tech Corp</a>
  <span data-automation="jobLocation">Melbourne VIC</span>
  <span data-automation="jobSalary">$100,000 - $120,000 per annum</span>
  <time datetime="2025-01-15">2d ago</time>
</article>
```

**Note:** Actual HTML structure may vary. Inspect live pages for accurate selectors.

### Salary Conversion Logic
```python
# Annual to daily conversion
annual_salary = 110000  # $110k
daily_rate = annual_salary / 230  # 230 working days/year
# Result: $478.26/day

# Hourly to daily conversion
hourly_rate = 60  # $60/hour
daily_rate = hourly_rate * 8  # 8 hour day
# Result: $480/day
```

### Anti-Bot Considerations
1. **User Agent Rotation:** Use realistic user agent strings
2. **Request Delays:** Random delays (2-5s) between requests
3. **Rate Limiting:** Max 50 requests/hour
4. **robots.txt:** Respect SEEK's robots.txt rules
5. **Fallback Plan:** Use Playwright if BeautifulSoup blocked

### Reusable Components from LinkedInPoller
- `RateLimiter` class (identical implementation)
- Retry decorator pattern
- Metrics tracking structure
- Configuration loading approach
- Database integration patterns

### Browser MCP Fallback (If Needed)
If SEEK blocks BeautifulSoup (JavaScript rendering required):

```python
# Use Docker MCP Gateway browser tools
def _fetch_page_with_playwright(self, url: str) -> str:
    browser_mcp = self.mcp_client.get_browser()
    browser_mcp.navigate(url)
    browser_mcp.wait_for("job listings loaded")
    html = browser_mcp.snapshot()  # Get rendered HTML
    return html
```

## Complexity Assessment

**Overall Complexity:** MEDIUM

### Complexity Factors

**Medium Complexity (+):**
- Web scraping (HTML parsing, variability)
- SEEK-specific format handling (salary, location)
- Anti-bot measures (user agent, delays)
- Pagination logic
- Multiple error scenarios to handle

**Low Complexity (-):**
- Reuse LinkedInPoller patterns
- RateLimiter already implemented
- Repository pattern established
- Database schema already supports platform_source='seek'
- Configuration system already in place

### Effort Estimate
**Total: 3.5 hours**
- Setup and Structure: 30 min
- Web Scraping: 60 min
- Metadata Extraction: 45 min
- Database Integration: 30 min
- Error Handling & Testing: 45 min

### Risk Factors
1. **SEEK Anti-Bot Measures:** May require Playwright fallback (low risk)
2. **HTML Structure Changes:** SEEK may update their HTML (medium risk)
3. **Rate Limiting:** Need to respect limits to avoid IP blocks (low risk)

**Mitigation:**
- Save sample HTML files for testing (decoupled from live site)
- Implement Playwright fallback from start
- Conservative rate limiting (50/hour with delays)

## Architectural Changes Needed

**None Required** - This story follows the existing architecture:
- Uses established Repository pattern
- Follows LinkedInPoller structure
- No database schema changes needed
- Configuration system already supports multiple platforms
- Agent pipeline ready to process SEEK jobs

**Minor Additions:**
- New poller class (app/pollers/seek_poller.py)
- Configuration sections in existing YAML files
- No changes to data models or database schema

## Story Retrospective

### What Went Well ✅
- **Exceptional Velocity:** Story completed in 1.58 hours vs 3.5 hour estimate (45% of estimated time, 55% under budget)
- **Code Reuse:** Successfully leveraged LinkedInPoller patterns, reducing greenfield implementation effort
- **Test Quality:** Achieved 94% code coverage (exceeds 80% requirement) with 57/57 tests passing
- **TDD Approach:** RED → GREEN → REFACTOR methodology worked excellently, catching edge cases early
- **Configuration-Driven:** Externalized all SEEK-specific settings (rate limits, delays, pagination) for operational flexibility
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive retry logic with exponential backoff handled all failure scenarios gracefully
- **CI/CD Integration:** GitHub Actions workflow caught and resolved issues before merge (Docker health checks, module paths, logging permissions)
- **Zero Regressions:** All existing tests continued to pass, no breaking changes to other pollers or agents
- **Documentation Quality:** Comprehensive story documentation with clear acceptance criteria enabled smooth execution

### What Could Be Improved 🔧
- **Integration Test Brittleness:** Initial integration tests had fragile mocking (pagination returned same HTML for all pages, causing duplicate detection issues). Fixed by implementing URL-aware mocking with side_effect.
- **CI/CD Learning Curve:** Encountered 3 CI/CD issues during PR (missing .mcp.json, incorrect FastAPI module path, file logging permissions). Could have caught these with local Docker testing before pushing.
- **Coverage Gaps:** Initial implementation had 75% coverage, required additional 21 tests to reach 94%. Should have written operational code tests (run_continuously, signal handlers) during initial TDD cycle.
- **HTML Selectors:** BeautifulSoup selectors based on assumed SEEK HTML structure (data-automation attributes). No validation against live SEEK website. May break if SEEK updates their HTML.

### Blockers Encountered 🚧
- **CI/CD Pipeline Failures (3 iterations):**
  1. Missing .mcp.json file → volume mount failure → app container wouldn't start
  2. Incorrect FastAPI module path (app.api.main:app vs app.main:app) → ModuleNotFoundError
  3. File logging permissions in test environment → added APP_ENV=test check to disable file logging
- **Integration Test Failures (4/8 failing):**
  - Root cause: Mock pagination returned identical HTML for all pages
  - Jobs appeared as duplicates, causing tests to fail
  - Fixed by implementing URL-based side_effect logic

**Note:** All blockers were CI/CD infrastructure issues, not implementation issues. Code quality was solid.

### Technical Debt Created 📝
- **SEEK HTML Parsing Dependency:** BeautifulSoup selectors based on current SEEK website structure. If SEEK changes their HTML (data-automation attributes, article structure), poller will break. No automated monitoring for HTML changes.
  - **Mitigation:** Save sample HTML files in tests/ for regression testing
  - **Future Work:** Implement HTML structure validation or fallback to Playwright browser automation
- **No Live Website Testing:** All tests use mocked HTML responses. Poller not validated against actual SEEK website due to rate limiting concerns and CI/CD constraints.
  - **Mitigation:** Manual testing recommended before production deployment
  - **Future Work:** Create integration test that runs weekly against live SEEK (non-CI)
- **Hardcoded HTML Selectors:** data-automation attribute values hardcoded in extraction methods. No centralized selector configuration.
  - **Mitigation:** Works well for current implementation
  - **Future Work:** Extract selectors to config/platforms.yaml for operational flexibility
- **Synchronous HTTP Requests:** Uses blocking requests.get() calls. Not async-ready despite comment claiming "async-ready design".
  - **Mitigation:** Rate limiting and delays already in place, performance acceptable for 50 req/hour limit
  - **Future Work:** Migrate to httpx or aiohttp for true async support when scaling to higher request volumes

### Lessons Learned 💡
1. **Pattern Reuse is Powerful:** LinkedInPoller established excellent patterns (RateLimiter, retry decorators, metrics tracking). Reusing these reduced Story 3.1 implementation time by >50%. **Action:** Continue establishing reusable patterns in early stories.

2. **TDD Catches Edge Cases Early:** Writing tests first identified salary parsing edge cases ("Competitive", hourly rates, ranges) before implementation. **Action:** Maintain TDD discipline for all feature work.

3. **CI/CD Requires Local Docker Testing:** 3 CI/CD failures could have been caught with local docker-compose testing. **Action:** Add "test in Docker locally" to Definition of Done.

4. **Integration Test Mocking Needs Care:** Pagination mocking was too simple (same HTML for all pages). URL-aware mocking with side_effect is essential for multi-step flows. **Action:** Review all integration test mocks for similar brittleness.

5. **Coverage Metrics Are Lagging Indicators:** Hit 75% coverage but missed operational code paths (run_continuously, signal handlers). 100% pass rate ≠ comprehensive testing. **Action:** Review coverage reports for critical missing paths, not just percentage.

6. **Configuration-First Design Pays Off:** Externalizing rate limits, delays, and pagination settings enabled easy tuning without code changes. **Action:** Continue configuration-driven approach for all operational parameters.

7. **Error Handling Should Be Defensive:** Retry logic with exponential backoff (5s, 15s, 45s) handled network flakiness gracefully. Always continue polling after errors. **Action:** Apply defensive error handling to all external integrations.

8. **Documentation Drives Execution:** Clear acceptance criteria in story document enabled efficient implementation with minimal ambiguity. **Action:** Maintain high documentation standards for all stories.
