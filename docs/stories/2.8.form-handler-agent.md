# Story 2.8: Form Handler Agent

## Status
âœ… **Done**

**Started:** 2025-10-29
**Completed:** 2025-10-29
**Branch:** feature/story-2-8-form-handler-agent (merged to main)
**PR:** #15

## Story
**As a** Form Handler Agent,
**I want to** automate job application form submission,
**so that** approved applications are submitted efficiently without manual intervention.

## Context
Final (seventh) specialized agent in the 7-agent pipeline. The Form Handler Agent takes approved jobs from the Orchestrator Agent and automates the submission process using browser automation. This is the culmination of the entire pipeline - actually submitting the application!

## Dependencies
- âœ… Story 2.1: Agent Base Class
- âœ… Story 2.7: Orchestrator Agent (provides approved jobs)
- ðŸ“¦ Playwright library (browser automation)

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC 1: FormHandlerAgent Class Implementation
- [ ] Create `FormHandlerAgent` in `app/agents/form_handler_agent.py`
- [ ] Inherit from `BaseAgent`
- [ ] Implement `async def process(self, job_id: str) -> AgentResult`
- [ ] Override `agent_name` to return "form_handler"
- [ ] Override `model` to return "claude-sonnet-4" (for form analysis)

### AC 2: Browser Automation Setup
- [ ] Initialize Playwright browser instance
- [ ] Support headless and headed modes (configurable)
- [ ] Set up browser context with realistic user agent
- [ ] Handle browser cleanup on success/failure
- [ ] Screenshot capture for verification

### AC 3: Job Application URL Navigation
- [ ] Load job application URL from job data
- [ ] Wait for page to load completely
- [ ] Verify page loaded successfully
- [ ] Handle redirects and authentication requirements
- [ ] Detect "application already submitted" scenarios

### AC 4: Form Field Detection
- [ ] Detect input fields (text, email, tel, textarea)
- [ ] Detect select/dropdown fields
- [ ] Detect file upload fields (resume, cover letter)
- [ ] Identify required vs optional fields
- [ ] Use Claude to analyze form structure if needed

### AC 5: Form Field Population
- [ ] Fill text fields (name, email, phone, address)
- [ ] Fill textarea fields (additional information)
- [ ] Select dropdown options (years of experience, etc.)
- [ ] Check checkboxes (terms and conditions, etc.)
- [ ] Handle conditional fields (show/hide based on selections)

### AC 6: File Upload Handling
- [ ] Upload CV file from stage_outputs (cv_tailor.cv_file_path)
- [ ] Upload CL file from stage_outputs (cover_letter_writer.cl_file_path)
- [ ] Verify files uploaded successfully
- [ ] Handle file size limits
- [ ] Handle file format requirements

### AC 7: Form Submission
- [ ] Click submit button
- [ ] Wait for submission to complete
- [ ] Capture confirmation page/message
- [ ] Take screenshot of confirmation
- [ ] Extract confirmation number if available

### AC 8: Submission Verification
- [ ] Verify submission succeeded (confirmation message/page)
- [ ] Check for error messages
- [ ] Verify redirect to success page
- [ ] Store submission evidence (screenshots, confirmation)
- [ ] Return success/failure status

### AC 9: Database Updates
- [ ] Update application_tracking:
  - Update `current_stage` to "form_handler"
  - Append to `completed_stages`
  - Store output in `stage_outputs`:
    ```json
    {
      "form_handler": {
        "submitted": true,
        "submission_time": "2025-10-29T10:30:00Z",
        "confirmation_number": "APP-12345",
        "confirmation_screenshot": "path/to/screenshot.png",
        "application_url": "https://...",
        "fields_filled": ["name", "email", "phone", "resume", "cover_letter"],
        "submission_method": "automated"
      }
    }
    ```
  - Update status:
    - Success: "submitted"
    - Failure: "submission_failed"

### AC 10: Error Handling & Retries
- [ ] Handle missing application URL
- [ ] Handle page load failures
- [ ] Handle form detection failures
- [ ] Handle file upload errors
- [ ] Implement retry logic (up to 3 attempts)
- [ ] Store error details for debugging
- [ ] Always return AgentResult

### AC 11: Unit Tests
- [ ] Test file: `tests/unit/agents/test_form_handler_agent.py`
- [ ] Tests for: structure, browser setup, form detection, field population, file upload, submission, verification, error handling
- [ ] Mock Playwright browser interactions
- [ ] Minimum 85% coverage

### AC 12: Integration Tests
- [ ] Deferred to future - not blocking
- [ ] Would require test job boards

## Technical Details

### Playwright Setup

```python
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright, Browser, Page

async def _init_browser(self) -> Browser:
    """Initialize Playwright browser."""
    playwright = await async_playwright().start()
    browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(
        headless=self._config.get("headless", True),
        args=["--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled"]
    )
    return browser

async def _create_page(self, browser: Browser) -> Page:
    """Create browser page with realistic context."""
    context = await browser.new_context(
        user_agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7)...",
        viewport={"width": 1920, "height": 1080},
        locale="en-AU"
    )
    page = await context.new_page()
    return page
```

### Form Detection

```python
async def _detect_form_fields(self, page: Page) -> dict:
    """Detect all form fields on the page."""
    fields = {
        "text_fields": await page.query_selector_all("input[type='text'], input[type='email'], input[type='tel']"),
        "textareas": await page.query_selector_all("textarea"),
        "selects": await page.query_selector_all("select"),
        "file_uploads": await page.query_selector_all("input[type='file']"),
        "checkboxes": await page.query_selector_all("input[type='checkbox']")
    }
    return fields
```

### File Upload

```python
async def _upload_file(self, page: Page, selector: str, file_path: str) -> bool:
    """Upload file to form."""
    try:
        file_input = await page.query_selector(selector)
        await file_input.set_input_files(file_path)
        logger.info(f"[form_handler] Uploaded file: {file_path}")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"[form_handler] File upload failed: {e}")
        return False
```

### Submission Verification

```python
async def _verify_submission(self, page: Page) -> dict:
    """Verify form submission succeeded."""
    # Wait for confirmation message or redirect
    await page.wait_for_timeout(3000)

    # Check for success indicators
    success_selectors = [
        "text=Thank you for applying",
        "text=Application submitted",
        ".success-message",
        ".confirmation"
    ]

    for selector in success_selectors:
        element = await page.query_selector(selector)
        if element:
            text = await element.text_content()
            return {"success": True, "message": text}

    # Check for error indicators
    error_selectors = [".error", ".alert-danger", "text=Error"]
    for selector in error_selectors:
        element = await page.query_selector(selector)
        if element:
            text = await element.text_content()
            return {"success": False, "error": text}

    return {"success": False, "error": "Could not verify submission"}
```

## Notes

### Playwright Installation
```bash
poetry add playwright
playwright install chromium
```

### Security Considerations
- Do not log sensitive information (passwords, etc.)
- Sanitize screenshot filenames
- Store screenshots securely
- Handle authentication tokens carefully

### Future Enhancements
- Support for multiple job board layouts
- Captcha detection and handling
- LinkedIn Easy Apply support
- Seek apply support
- Form field mapping configuration
