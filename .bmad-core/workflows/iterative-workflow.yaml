  description: >-
    FULLY AUTONOMOUS agent workflow for iterative development of the automated job application system.
    The bmad-orchestrator controls all flow operations and agents continue execution until ALL epics
    and user stories are complete. NO USER INTERACTION REQUIRED. Each story from the PRD epics is
    fully developed, tested with pytest achieving 90% code coverage, and merged before the next story begins.
    The system includes 7 AI agents (Job Matcher, Salary Validator, CV Tailor, Cover Letter Writer, QA,
    Orchestrator, Application Handler) that process jobs through a pipeline. Stories are developed by the
    BMad dev agent, validated by the BMad QA agent, and reviewed by the BMad architect before merge.
    The bmad-orchestrator autonomously selects and sequences all stories across all 6 epics until project completion.

    process_control: |
      The bmad-orchestrator controls all workflow operations through the following autonomous process:

      1. INITIALIZATION PHASE (Automatic):
         - Verify prerequisites without user confirmation
         - Load PRD epic definitions from docs/prd/
         - Initialize story tracking (28 total MVP stories across 6 epics)
         - Set execution state: Epic 1, Story 1.1

      2. STORY EXECUTION LOOP (Continuous):
         For each story in sequential order (1.1 → 1.2 → ... → 6.4):
           a. Story Selection: SM autonomously selects next story
           b. Story Planning: SM creates implementation plan
           c. Architecture Review: Architect reviews if needed (conditional)
           d. TDD Implementation: Dev implements with tests (90% coverage minimum)
           e. Quality Validation: Dev validates code quality gates
           f. QA Testing: QA validates all acceptance criteria
           g. Fix Cycle: Dev fixes issues, QA retests (iterate until pass)
           h. Final Review: Architect approves implementation
           i. SM Approval: SM verifies story completion
           j. PR Creation: SM creates pull request
           k. BMad Review: BMad Master reviews and approves
           l. PR Merge: BMad Master merges to main
           m. Retrospective: SM documents completion

      3. EPIC TRANSITION (Automatic):
         When all stories in current epic complete:
           - PM documents epic completion
           - bmad-orchestrator automatically proceeds to next epic
           - No user approval needed
           - Process continues with next epic's Story X.1

      4. PROJECT COMPLETION (Final):
         When all 6 epics complete (28 stories total):
           - BMad Master performs final project review
           - Generate comprehensive project summary
           - Workflow terminates with success

      5. ERROR HANDLING (Autonomous):
         - Quality gate failures: Automatically return to previous step
         - Test failures: Automatically trigger fix cycle (dev → qa loop)
         - Merge conflicts: Automatically attempt resolution or flag for dev
         - Critical failures: Log issue, attempt auto-remediation, continue if possible

      6. DECISION POINTS (All Automatic):
         - Complex story needs analysis? → Analyst step (conditional, auto-triggered)
         - Architectural changes needed? → Architect review (conditional, auto-triggered)
         - QA tests failed? → Dev fixes step (conditional, auto-triggered)
         - PR changes requested? → Dev fixes + QA retest (conditional, auto-triggered)
         - More stories in epic? → Loop to story_selection (automatic)
         - Epic complete? → Epic completion → Next epic (automatic)
         - All epics complete? → Project completion (automatic)

      CONTINUOUS OPERATION: The bmad-orchestrator maintains execution state and ensures
      uninterrupted progress through all 28 stories until project completion. Agents are
      activated in sequence based on workflow steps, complete their tasks, and hand off
      to the next agent automatically.

  sequence:
    - step: prerequisites_check
      agent: sm
      action: verify prerequisites and environment
      orchestrated_by: bmad-orchestrator
      notes: |
        ORCHESTRATOR-CONTROLLED: bmad-orchestrator initiates and monitors this step.

        Scrum Master autonomously verifies before starting:
        - Python 3.11+ environment configured
        - Redis server running for job queue (docker or local)
        - DuckDB database initialized (data/jobs.duckdb)
        - All dependencies from requirements.txt installed
        - Configuration files present (search.yaml, agents.yaml, platforms.yaml)
        - PRD at docs/prd/ directory with all epic files
        - Architecture docs at docs/architecture/
        - LinkedIn MCP server configured in .mcp.json
        - All unit tests from previous story passed with 90% coverage

        NO USER INTERACTION: bmad-orchestrator automatically proceeds to story_selection once prerequisites are verified.
        If prerequisites fail, orchestrator logs issues and attempts auto-remediation where possible.

    - step: story_selection
      agent: sm
      action: select next story from PRD epics
      orchestrated_by: bmad-orchestrator

      notes: |
        ORCHESTRATOR-CONTROLLED: bmad-orchestrator directs SM to autonomously select the next story in sequence.

        SM automatically selects the next story from PRD epic sequence following strict sequential order:
        - Epic 1: Foundation (Stories 1.1-1.5)
        - Epic 2: Core Agents (Stories 2.1-2.8)
        - Epic 3: Duplicate Detection (Stories 3.1-3.3)

        - Epic 5: Gradio UI (Stories 5.1-5.5)
        - Epic 6: Testing & Refinement (Stories 6.1-6.4)

        PROCESS FOLLOWED:
        1. Check completed stories in docs/stories/ directory
        2. Identify next incomplete story based on epic/story numbering
        3. Verify all prerequisite stories are complete
        4. Automatically create feature branch: feature/story-{epic}-{story}
        5. Proceed to story_planning step without user confirmation

        bmad-orchestrator ensures continuous flow through all 28 MVP stories until project completion.

    - step: story_planning
      agent: sm
      action: review story acceptance criteria and create implementation plan

    - step: story_implementation
      agent: dev
      action: implement story using Test-Driven Development (TDD)
      orchestrated_by: bmad-orchestrator
      creates: implementation_files
      requires: docs/stories/{epic}.{story}.{title}.md
      branch: feature/story-{epic}-{story}
      notes: |
        ORCHESTRATOR-CONTROLLED: bmad-orchestrator initiates TDD implementation cycle for the story.

        Developer autonomously implements story using TDD methodology:

        **SETUP:**
        - Read story requirements in docs/stories/{epic}.{story}.{title}.md
        - Review relevant architecture docs
        - Understand existing codebase structure

        **FOR EACH ACCEPTANCE CRITERION - Follow TDD Cycle:**

        1. RED PHASE - Write failing tests first:
           * Write unit tests using pytest
           * Tests should fail initially (no implementation yet)
           * Include edge cases, error scenarios, input validation
           * Create test files in tests/ directory
           * Use appropriate fixtures and mocks

        2. GREEN PHASE - Write minimal code to pass:
           * Implement just enough code to make tests pass
           * For Epic 1 stories: Database operations, configuration loading, job polling
           * For Epic 2 stories: Agent classes, Claude API integration, checkpoint system
           * For Epic 3 stories: Duplicate detection algorithms, similarity scoring
           * For Epic 4 stories: Form submission, email sending, Playwright automation
           * For Epic 5 stories: Gradio UI components, real-time dashboards
           * Run tests: pytest tests/ -v

        3. REFACTOR PHASE - Improve code quality:
           * Refactor while keeping tests green
           * Follow Python best practices and type hints
           * Ensure clean architecture and maintainability
           * Use proper error handling and logging (loguru)

        4. VERIFY & DOCUMENT:
           * Run full test suite: pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=term
           * Check coverage: Must achieve minimum 90% code coverage
           * Update docs/stories/{epic}.{story}.{title}.md with:
             - Test files created
             - Coverage percentage achieved
             - Mark acceptance criterion as complete [x]

        **INTEGRATION TESTING:**
        - FastAPI endpoints: Test with FastAPI TestClient
        - Database operations: Test DuckDB queries and schema
        - Redis queue: Test job enqueue/dequeue operations
        - Agent pipeline: Test agent execution and checkpointing
        - LinkedIn MCP: Test job discovery integration
        - Claude API: Test prompt/response handling

        **MANDATORY BEFORE HANDOFF TO QA:**
        * All unit tests must pass (100% pass rate)
        * Code coverage must be ≥90%
        * All acceptance criteria have corresponding tests
        * Test results documented in story file
        * Code follows project structure (app/, tests/, config/)
        * Type hints added (run mypy for validation)
        * Logging added for debugging

        Commit all code and tests with descriptive messages

    - step: code_quality_validation
      agent: dev
      action: validate code quality and test coverage
      validates: code_quality_gates
      required_before: qa_testing_cycle
      notes: |
        Developer validates before QA handoff:

        **CODE QUALITY CHECKS:**
        - Run linter: ruff check app/ tests/
        - Run formatter: black --check app/ tests/
        - Run type checker: mypy app/
        - Fix any issues found

        **TEST VALIDATION:**
        - Run full test suite: pytest tests/ -v
        - Generate coverage report: pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
        - Verify metrics:
          * All unit tests passing (100% pass rate)
          * Code coverage ≥90% overall
          * Each acceptance criterion has corresponding tests
          * No untested public methods or classes

        **DOCUMENTATION:**
        - Update docs/stories/{epic}.{story}.{title}.md:
          * Test execution results
          * Coverage percentage achieved
          * List of test files created
          * Any known limitations or edge cases

        **MANUAL TESTING:**
        - Test FastAPI endpoints manually (if applicable)
        - Test agent execution with sample jobs (if applicable)
        - Verify Redis queue operations (if applicable)
        - Check DuckDB database state (if applicable)

        If validation fails:
        - Return to TDD cycle
        - Write missing tests
        - Fix code quality issues
        - Achieve required coverage

        Only proceed to QA when all gates pass

    - step: qa_testing_cycle
      agent: qa
      action: verify all acceptance criteria and quality standards
      orchestrated_by: bmad-orchestrator
      updates: docs/stories/{epic}.{story}.{title}.md
      requires:
        - docs/prd/epic-{epic}.md
        - code_quality_validation
      iterates: until_all_criteria_pass
      notes: |
        ORCHESTRATOR-CONTROLLED: bmad-orchestrator manages QA testing cycle and automatic iteration.

        QA Agent autonomously tests each acceptance criterion from PRD:

        **FIRST - Verify test coverage from Dev:**

        - Review coverage report in docs/stories/{epic}.{story}.{title}.md
        - Verify ≥90% code coverage achieved
        - Check all acceptance criteria have unit tests
        - If unit tests insufficient:
          * REJECT handoff back to Dev
          * List missing test scenarios
          * Require completion of TDD cycle

  agent_responsibilities:
    orchestration_control: |
      The bmad-orchestrator controls agent activation and manages all handoffs:

      AGENT ACTIVATION SEQUENCE (per story):
        1. Scrum Master (SM) - Prerequisites, Selection, Planning, Approval, PR Creation, Retrospective
        2. Business Analyst (Analyst) - Requirements Clarification [CONDITIONAL]
        3. Technical Architect (Architect) - Architecture Review [CONDITIONAL], Final Review
        4. Developer (Dev) - TDD Implementation, Quality Validation, Fixes
        5. QA Tester (QA) - Testing Cycle, Retesting, PR Verification
        6. BMad Master - PR Review, Approval, Merge, Project Completion

      AUTOMATIC HANDOFF PROTOCOL:
        - Agents complete their task and signal completion to orchestrator

      BMAD-ORCHESTRATOR CONTINUOUS EXECUTION MODEL:

      The bmad-orchestrator maintains a persistent execution loop that continues
      until all 6 epics (28 total stories) are complete. No user interaction is
      required at any point in the workflow.

      EXECUTION STATE MACHINE:
        State: {current_epic: int, current_story: int, total_completed: int}
        Initial: {current_epic: 1, current_story: 1, total_completed: 0}
        Final: {current_epic: 6, current_story: 4, total_completed: 28}

      LOOPING MECHANISM:
        OUTER LOOP (Epic Level):
          FOR epic IN [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]:
            INNER LOOP (Story Level):
              FOR story IN epic.stories:
                EXECUTE story_workflow_cycle(epic, story)
                IF story_workflow_cycle.status == MERGED:
                  total_completed += 1
                  CONTINUE to next story
                ELSE:
                  RETRY story_workflow_cycle until MERGED
              END FOR
            EXECUTE epic_completion_review(epic)
            IF epic < 6:
              CONTINUE to next epic (NO USER APPROVAL)
          END FOR
        EXECUTE project_completion_review()
        TERMINATE with success

      STORY WORKFLOW CYCLE (Executed for each story):
        1. prerequisites_check → 2. story_selection → 3. story_planning →
        4. [conditional: requirements_clarification] →
        5. [conditional: architecture_review] → 6. story_implementation →
        7. code_quality_validation → 8. qa_testing_cycle →
        9. [conditional loop: dev_fixes → qa_retest until pass] →
        10. architect_final_review → 11. sm_story_approval →
        12. create_pull_request → 13. bmad_pr_review →
        14. [conditional loop: pr_changes_requested → qa_verify_pr_changes until approved] →
        15. bmad_pr_approval → 16. story_retrospective →
        17. next_story_decision → RETURN to step 2 OR proceed to epic_completion

      AUTONOMOUS DECISION LOGIC:
        - All conditionals are evaluated automatically by bmad-orchestrator
        - No user prompts or confirmations at any decision point
        - Failed quality gates trigger automatic retry loops
        - Story sequence is strictly ordered (1.1 → 1.2 → ... → 6.4)
        - Epic transitions happen automatically when all stories complete
        - Workflow only terminates when all 28 stories are merged to main

    when_to_use:
      - Multiple stories across 6 epics need sequential development
      - Python/FastAPI backend development with LLM integration
      - Multi-agent system requiring careful testing
      - Quality gates are critical for production readiness
      - Team requires clear handoffs between specialists
      - PR review process is mandatory
      - Story-by-story tracking needed for complex system
      - FULLY AUTONOMOUS execution required without user intervention

    benefits:
      - Clear accountability at each step
      - No story left incomplete
      - Continuous quality validation with 90% coverage
      - Clean git history with feature branches
      - Predictable velocity across epics
      - Reduced merge conflicts
      - Specialist expertise applied at right time
      - Architecture compliance enforced
      - High-quality automated job application system
