# Review Pull Request Task

## Task Overview
Comprehensive pull request review with authority to approve or request changes.

## Inputs
- `pr_number`: Pull request number to review
- `repository`: Repository name (e.g., "owner/repo")

## Outputs
- PR review comments
- Approval/Request Changes decision
- Summary report

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Fetch PR Details
```bash
# Get PR information
gh pr view {pr_number} --json title,body,author,headRefName,baseRefName,files
```

Parse and understand:
- PR title and description
- Linked issues/stories
- Author and context
- Changed files

### Step 2: Analyze Changed Files
```bash
# Get file changes
gh pr diff {pr_number}
```

Review each changed file:
- Understand purpose of changes
- Check for unintended modifications
- Note scope and complexity

### Step 3: Security Scan

Load `.bmad-core/checklists/security-checklist.md` and check:

**üö® Critical Security Issues:**
- [ ] Search for exposed secrets: `grep -r "api[_-]key\|password\|secret\|token" --include="*.py" --include="*.js" --include="*.env*"`
- [ ] Check for SQL injection risks
- [ ] Check for command injection with os.system/subprocess
- [ ] Check for hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Verify input validation present

**Document any security findings with severity.**

### Step 4: Code Quality Review

Load `.bmad-core/checklists/code-review-checklist.md` and assess:

**Critical Issues:**
- [ ] Tests passing?
- [ ] Breaking changes handled?
- [ ] Data integrity preserved?

**Warnings:**
- [ ] Clear naming conventions?
- [ ] Error handling present?
- [ ] Code duplication?
- [ ] Documentation adequate?

**Suggestions:**
- [ ] Simplification opportunities?
- [ ] Performance improvements?
- [ ] Maintainability enhancements?

### Step 5: Test Validation

Check test status:
```bash
# View PR checks status
gh pr checks {pr_number}
```

Verify:
- [ ] All CI checks passing
- [ ] Test coverage adequate
- [ ] New tests for new functionality
- [ ] Integration tests appropriate

### Step 6: Generate Review Comments

For each issue found, create a structured comment:

```yaml
file: path/to/file.py
line: 45
severity: critical|warning|suggestion
issue: Description of the issue
example: |
  # Current code problem
  def bad_example():
      ...

  # Suggested fix
  def good_example():
      ...
```

### Step 7: Make Decision

Based on findings:

**APPROVE** ‚úÖ if:
- No critical issues
- All tests passing
- Warnings are minor/acceptable
- Quality standards met

**REQUEST CHANGES** üîÑ if:
- Critical security issues present
- Tests failing
- Multiple significant warnings
- Breaking changes without migration

**COMMENT** üí¨ if:
- Only suggestions
- Minor improvements recommended
- No blocking issues

### Step 8: Submit Review

```bash
# Approve PR
gh pr review {pr_number} --approve --body "Review summary..."

# Or request changes
gh pr review {pr_number} --request-changes --body "Issues found..."

# Or just comment
gh pr review {pr_number} --comment --body "Suggestions..."
```

### Step 9: Document Review

Create review summary with:
- Total files changed
- Critical issues found (count)
- Warnings found (count)
- Suggestions made (count)
- Decision and rationale
- Time to fix estimate (if changes requested)
